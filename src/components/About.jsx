            <h3>In his work as a journalist, performer and diviner, David Odyssey charts a course through the stories of the real and the mythic.</h3>

            <h3>As a former editor at Time Out New York, and as a contributor to DAZED, Vulture, EW, The InQueery and other sites, he has covered queer, alternative and emerging artistic scenes.</h3> 
            
            <h3>On his podcast The Luminaries and at live salons and cabaret shows, he explores the origin stories and cosmic makeup of his guests (and uncovers his own epic saga). Through Tarot and astrology, he offers an archetypal framework for the current moment. He lives, eternally, in New York City. </h3>
